  ### Find all dig attempts that lead to an attack (CRT)
  # For a play to be counted towards CRT, it must meet the following criteria:
  # (1) It must be a dig attempt (spike covers do not count)
  # (2) There must be an attack within the next two plays
  # (3) The attack must be by the same team that made the dig
  # (4) The dig must allow for a "structured" attack, in other words, it must be in system
  # Note: In theory, the attack can come on the play right after the dig. In practice, those plays almost universally violate criterion (4).
